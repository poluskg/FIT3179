    <h1>Analysis of the 2016 US Presidential Election</h1>
    <br>
    <div>
    The results of the 2016 US Presidential Election were controversial to say the least.
With the announcement of Donald Trump winning the Presidency in favour of the opposing candidate, Hilary Clinton, many questioned the legitimacy of the outcome. 
</div>
<br>
<div</div>
The Electoral College is a group of presidential electors who are required by the United States Constitution to form every four years for the sole purpose of electing both the President and Vice President of the United States.
</div>
<br>
<div>
There are 538 electors and an absolute majority of electoral votes, 270 or more, is required to win the election. The annotated map displays the allocated electoral votes to each state. These weights are based on populations from the previous Census.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with <b>304</b> votes in comparison to Hilary Clintonâ€™s <b>227</b> votes, despite Clinton winning the popular vote by over 1 million citizen votes. 7 electors voted for other candidates.

  <h2>Understanding Voter Attributes</h2>
  <div>Different candidates appeal to voters for different reasons. Establishing a <b>profile</b> of the voter basis helps us to understand how one candidate can get over another.
  Appealing to a voter basis may result in a greater win. Understanding where the majority of the votes lie, and what those voters want allows the candidate to apepal more
    strongly to their voter basis.

    <h3> Voter Engagement Overtime </h3>
  <div>
    Voting in the United States is <b>not compulsory</b> and citizens can choose once they are of <b>legal voting age (21)</b> to register within their state or county such that they are able to vote in the election.
The below chart shows the percentage of eligible voters who engaged in the election, separated by voter demographic for the <b>past 8 Presidential elections</b>. Selecting part of the chart
    will display the proportion of registered voters alongside actual voter turnout as a percentage of the total eligible voters.
